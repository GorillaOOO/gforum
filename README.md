# GForum

GForum (derived from GorillaForum) is a Laravel forum package with simplicity in mind. So much simplicity, in fact, that it's really hard to tell whether OrphanDiaspora just gave up on adding something or decided not to in the name of minimalism. Find out!

# To-do

-   [ ] Basic posting, threads and replies, _et al_.
-   [ ] Image uploading & perceptual hash banning.
-   [ ] Account registration, avatars, signatures etc.
-   [ ] A decent API that allows people to build up their own clients, or use cURL for bots, etc.
-   [ ] RSS feeds would be nice, as well.
